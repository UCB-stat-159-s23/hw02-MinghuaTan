_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Spring 2022 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-s22.github.io). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._

Notes
****
The environment.yml file should list all Python libraries on which your notebooks depend, specified as though they were created using the following conda commands:

    conda activate example-environment
    conda env export --from-history -f environment.yml

Note that the only libraries available to you will be the ones specified in the environment.yml, so be sure to include everything that you need!

Also note that if you skip the --from-history, conda may include OS-specific packages in environment.yml, which you would have to manually prune from environment.yml. For example, confirmed macOS-specific packages that should be removed are:

  - python=3.9
  - ipykernel==5.5
  - numpy==1.23
  - scipy==1.8
  - h5py==3.7
  - matplotlib==3.5
